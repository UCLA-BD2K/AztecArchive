The principle of the quantification is described in Pesavento et al. (Analytical Chemistry, 2006). We recommend the use of the software for middle-down or top-down analyses, as it is suitable for direct comparison of single sequences with scrambled combinatorial PTMs. The user interface provides a choice for CID/HCD or ETD fragmentation.
