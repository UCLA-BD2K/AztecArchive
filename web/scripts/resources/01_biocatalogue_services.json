The service implementation has a clever mechanism that stores incoming and outgoing attachments on the hard drive without loading it into memory. This should allow for very large transfers. \n\nThe service is supposed to work with any SOAP stack that supports MTOM. There is a generic SOAP client available that can communicate with the service called soapUI (www.soapui.org). This client program works but it seems to have limitations on the file size when I have tested it, most likely due to loading the attachment into memory before sending it. Other client technologies also exist.\n\nThe service is installed on a development server, so please feel free to test it with large files (max 7 GB).","logo":"https://www.biocatalogue.org/assets/logo_small-da549203f66b74dab67f592878053664.png","source":"BioCatalogue","language":"HTML","platforms":["SOAP"],"sourceCodeURL":"http://sitron.bccs.uib.no:2288/axis2/services/FileDepot","linkDescriptions":["Homepage","Documentation","WSDL"],"linkUrls":["https://www.biocatalogue.org/services/3705",null,"http://api.bioinfo.no/wsdl/FileDepot.wsdl"],"institutions":[],"licenses":[],"licenseUrls":[],"maintainers":[],"maintainerEmails":[],"types":["Tool"],"tags":[],"domains":[]},

{"name":"FASTA (REST)","description":"FASTA (pronounced FAST-Aye) stands for FAST-All, reflecting the fact that it can be used for a fast protein comparison or a fast nucleotide comparison. This program achieves a high level of sensitivity for similarity searching at high speed. This is achieved by performing optimised searches for local alignments using a substitution matrix. The high speed of this program is achieved by using the observed pattern of word hits to identify potential matches before attempting the more time consuming optimised search. The trade-off between speed and sensitivity is controlled by the ktup parameter, which specifies the size of the word. Increasing the ktup decreases the number of background hits. Not every word hit is investigated but instead initially looks for segment's containing several nearby hits.\n","logo":"https://www.biocatalogue.org/assets/logo_small-da549203f66b74dab67f592878053664.png","source":"BioCatalogue","language":"HTML","platforms":["REST"],"sourceCodeURL":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/rest/fasta","linkDescriptions":["Homepage","Documentation","WSDL"],"linkUrls":["https://www.biocatalogue.org/services/2743","http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/services/sss/fasta_rest\n",null],"publicationDOI":"DOI: 10.1073/pnas.85.8.2444 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.85.8.2444)","institutions":["European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)"],"licenses":["EMBL-EBI Terms of Use: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/termsofuse.html\n"],"licenseUrls":[""],"maintainers":["http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/","EMBL-EBI Support: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/index.php?query=WebServices\n"],"maintainerEmails":["",""],"types":["Tool"],"tags":["Needleman-Wunsch","fastx","fasty","tfastx","tfasty","ssearch","ggsearch","glsearch","<http://www.mygrid.org.uk/ontology#Smith-Waterman_sequence_alignment_algorithm>","smith-waterman","fasta","Nucleotide Sequence Similarity","Protein Sequence Similarity"],"domains":["Genomics","Proteomics"]},

By default, T-Coffee will compare all your sequences two by two, producing a global alignment and a series of local alignments (using lalign).

{"name":"FASTA (SOAP)","description":"FASTA (pronounced FAST-Aye) stands for FAST-All, reflecting the fact that it can be used for a fast protein comparison or a fast nucleotide comparison. This program achieves a high level of sensitivity for similarity searching at high speed. This is achieved by performing optimised searches for local alignments using a substitution matrix. The high speed of this program is achieved by using the observed pattern of word hits to identify potential matches before attempting the more time consuming optimised search. The trade-off between speed and sensitivity is controlled by the ktup parameter, which specifies the size of the word. Increasing the ktup decreases the number of background hits. Not every word hit is investigated but instead initially looks for segment's containing several nearby hits.\n","logo":"https://www.biocatalogue.org/assets/logo_small-da549203f66b74dab67f592878053664.png","source":"BioCatalogue","language":"HTML","platforms":["SOAP"],"sourceCodeURL":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/soap/fasta","linkDescriptions":["Homepage","Documentation","WSDL"],"linkUrls":["https://www.biocatalogue.org/services/1929","SAWSDL: http://www.purl.org/SemanticallyAnnotated/fasta.sawsdl","http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/soap/fasta?wsdl"],"publicationDOI":"DOI: 10.1073/pnas.85.8.2444 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.85.8.2444)","institutions":["European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)"],"licenses":["EMBL-EBI Terms of Use: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/termsofuse.html\n"],"licenseUrls":[""],"maintainers":["http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/","EMBL-EBI Support: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/index.php?query=WebServices\n"],"maintainerEmails":["",""],"types":["Tool"],"tags":["tfastx","tfasty","fastx","fasty","smith-waterman","sequence similarity search","<http://www.mygrid.org.uk/ontology#FASTA>","ssearch","ggsearch","glsearch","<http://www.mygrid.org.uk/ontology#Smith-Waterman_sequence_alignment_algorithm>","Protein Sequence Similarity","Nucleotide Sequence Similarity"],"domains":["Proteomics","Genomics"]},
